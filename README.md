1. Students must have an account // a valid session before s/he proceeds to his/her enrollment/registration
Then student would be redirect to the registration/enrollment page

2. Admin/staff users could register students too, and achieve more administrations tasks

3. Students route
http://localhost:4000/users/new ==> for student's account
**this route have to be improve because it's the same with the admin user's registration page //In practice, it's not the case**
http://localhost:4000/session/new ==> for login the student

http://localhost:4000/admissions/new ==> for student's registration/enrollment

4. Admin route
http://localhost:4000/users/new ==> for admin's account

http://localhost:4000/session/new ==> for login the admin / staff member

http://localhost:4000/enr/admissions/new ==> for student's registration/enrollment
**Note the `ENR` scope looks like CMS admin part.**
